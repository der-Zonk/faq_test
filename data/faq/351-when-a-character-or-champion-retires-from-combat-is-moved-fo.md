question: "When a character or champion retires from combat, is moved for a challenge, or moves through the ranks, does this count as the unit moving for the purpose of related special rules (such as being 'entrenched')?"
answer: |
  No. The character (or champion) counts as moving when they retire, but the unit itself does not.
