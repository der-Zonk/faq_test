  GW FAQ
  The Fighting Rank CRB 145
answer: |
  When two opposing units are engaged in combat, only one row of models—the rank or file that is both in base contact and aligned (or almost in disordered charges) to the enemy’s engaged row—is considered the fighting rank. Other ranks or files that merely contain a single model in contact do not count as fighting ranks. Exceptions to this rule apply only to units in Lance Formation, Skirmishers, and Infantry (which has two fighting ranks in some cases), which may have different fighting rank rules.
