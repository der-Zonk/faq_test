question: "There are a some items, which have restrictions for \"characters\" regarding the acess or the use of these items. Can unit champions with access to magic items buy or use these items?"
change_log: |
  20.12.24: Added03.05.25 Clarified that champion item use follows character restrictions where applicable.
answer: |
  If the type of character is not specified further (for example "beastmen chieftain only or necromancer only"), champions are allowed to take and use these items with the same restrictions. If the items have any restrictions that apply generally to Characters, those restrictions also apply to non-Characters models that can take the items.
