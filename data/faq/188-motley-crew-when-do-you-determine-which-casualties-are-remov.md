answer: |
  Check at the beginning of each initiative step when attacks are made, then remove first those models which have a majority, then remove the rest, then step forward. Note that a champion that choses a wholly different weapon counts as a separate pool. In case of a tie, the controlling player decides which armour save to use and which models to remove (you have to remove the models of which you use the armour save).
