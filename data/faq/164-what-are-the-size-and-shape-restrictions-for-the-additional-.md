  Woodland Ambush FOF 145

The additional wood must measure between 8" and 12" at its widest point. It should be shaped to resemble a natural wooded area. If there is any doubt about what is acceptable, check with your opponent or the Tournament Organizer. Note that some tournaments may provide pre-defined woods or have specific guidelines for their appearance.
