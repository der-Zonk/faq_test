question: "Ogdruz Swampcalla and Branchwraith are now the only non‑updated Wizards with the wording \"knows spells from the following Lores of Magic” (multiples) instead of “uses spells from … OR …”— does that wording difference create an actual rules distinction?"

answer: |
  Yes. GW did issue an errata to the other wizards and did not issue an errata to these two. It was not a generalized FAQ, so the wordign remains. Therefore, the exceptions may have access to multiple Lores at the same time.
