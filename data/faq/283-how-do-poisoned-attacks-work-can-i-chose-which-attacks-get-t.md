Keep it as simple as possible - Just separate the poison hits from your normal attacks after directing attacks to the target and roll a separate batch of dices for the wound roll of these poisoned attacks. Keep dice batches for different targets separate during both to hit and to wound. Poisoned hits wil always apply to wound rolls of the same type of attacks they were made of in case the model has different weapons
