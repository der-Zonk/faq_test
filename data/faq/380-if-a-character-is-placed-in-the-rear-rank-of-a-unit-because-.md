question: "If a character is placed in the rear rank of a unit because there is no space for them in the front rank due to the presence of command models and/or other characters, is that character considered to have retired? Can they cast spells or provide benefits to their unit?"

answer: |
  A character that is placed in the rear rank for this reason has not retired. They provide bonuses to the unit they have joined and can cast spells without restriction, though they must still be in the fighting rank to cast assailment spells. A character in the rear rank can see through other models in its own unit, and as such may cast Magic Missile spells, perform shooting attacks, or take any other actions that require Line of Sight. In combat, the character may Move Through the Ranks to join the fighting rank as normal.
