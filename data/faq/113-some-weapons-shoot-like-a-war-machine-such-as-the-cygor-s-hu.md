question: "Some weapons shoot like a war machine, such as the Cygor's Hurl attack and the Steam Tank's Steam Cannon. Both state, \"If a 'Misfire' is rolled on the Artillery dice, this model loses a single Wound (instead of rolling on a Misfire table).\" If a Misfire is rolled, is the attack still successful?"

answer: |
  No. Not explicitly RAW. However, a Misfire result does not provide a numeric value that you need to carry out the attack. All results on a Misfire table result in the attack failing, and this seems like a reasonable extrapolation.
