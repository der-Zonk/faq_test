question: "What happens if a unit makes contact with another unit not being the charge target during the free wheel of alignement?"

  Accidental Contact during a Charge CRB 131

  12.1.26: Revision - you have to do a multicharge if there is no way around and you know you will hit them.
answer: |
  If it was clear at the time of the charge declaration that the projected charge will end like this and you will hit the second unit during alignment, no matter the charge roll, you have to declare a charge against both units. If there is a slight possibility to avoid this situation, the unit should try and wheel around that unit. If it is impossible to avoid the contact in any case with the given charge roll result (but would have been with a better charge roll result), the charging unit conducts an accidental contact during a charge and may chose to either halt the charge (leading to a disordered charge with most likely only 1 model in base contact against the original charge target) or to continue (leading to a disordered charge with both units, in which the accidental contacted units might try to align). If the unit continues into a fleeing unit, the fleeing unit is destroyed and the charging unit's movement comes to an end. The charged unit wheels to align if necessary, in which case the charging unit makes a disordered charge.
