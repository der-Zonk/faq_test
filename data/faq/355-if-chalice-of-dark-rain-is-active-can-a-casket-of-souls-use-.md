question: "If Chalice of Dark Rain is active, can a casket of souls use a magical missile? Are wailing dirges affected by it?"

answer: |
  Only the range of missile weapons is halved´, so the range of Magic Missiles, Wailing Dirge, Breath Weapons and similar rules are not affected (Sky Lantern Bombs), but war machines cannot shoot at all. Since the casket's magic missile is a shooting attack, it cannot be used in such a turn.
