question: "When items or abilites do enhance the Range of a Spell, do they also enhance the range of spell effects that are explained in the spells' description?"
---
Only the range for targeting units is extended, so spell effects are not increased. In Detail: For Vortex Spells, the range of effect is not enhanced, only the range for template placement. For Conveyance pells, the target range is increased but not the range of replacement (Travel Mystical Pathways, Infernal Gateway). For Spells with Self range, nothing is increased. For Gaze of Gork, the Range is extended.
