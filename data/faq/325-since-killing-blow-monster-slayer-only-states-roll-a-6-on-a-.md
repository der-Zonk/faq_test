question: "Since Killing Blow / Monster Slayer only states \"roll a 6 on a wound roll\" and Ethereal states \"cannot be wounded\" - does Killing Blow / Monster Slayer with non-magical attacks actually work against Ethereal?"

No! Killing Blow / Monster Slayer states that there has to be an "unsaved wound" for it to work - but Ethereal units can only be wounded by magical attacks.
