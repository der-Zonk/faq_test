question: "Are the attacks of \"Nurgling Infestation\" or similar abilities resolved with any weapon profile the model has equipped or in use?"
referenced_rules: |
  Daemons of Chaos
answer: |
  No, treat all such attacks which explicitly state a S and AP as attacks with hand weapons with the according profile. Note that universal special rules of the model (like armour bane or poisoned attacks) will translate to these attacks, but special rules of weapons that model uses don't.
