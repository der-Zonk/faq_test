question: "How do \"laser beam\" spells and attacks such as Gaze of Gork, Burning Gaze and Lightning Strike (from the Warp Lightning Canon) work?"
answer: |
  Once the spell is cast, choose a direction, then determine the distance of the line. This line does not require a target and therefore ignores all targeting rules, i.e. it can be drawn over LoS-blocking terrain, hit models in combat, lone characters, fanatics, and models the caster doesn't have LoS to.
