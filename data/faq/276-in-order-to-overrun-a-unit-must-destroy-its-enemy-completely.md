  This refers to all enemy units the unit is engaged in combat with—specifically, those in base contact. In combats involving multiple units, even if the enemy units in direct base contact are wiped out, the unit remains part of the combat until end of turn. Combat results still factor in this unit, and it must undergo any required break tests and suffer all consequences.
