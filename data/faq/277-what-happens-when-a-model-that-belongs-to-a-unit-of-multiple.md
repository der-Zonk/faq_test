question: "What happens when a model that belongs to a unit of multiple wound models suffers a hit or a wound, specifically by a source that hits models (dangerous terrain tests, peril tests, cannon fire)?"
referenced_rules: |
  Multiple Wound Models CRB 102
answer: |
  Besides the champion, always use the rule for removing casualties from multiple wound models ( 102). Resolve the hits against the specific model but if another model is already wounded, that model will suffer the lost wounds - always allocate wounds to one model after another. If a model would lose more wounds than it has in its wound characteristic by such attacks or hits, the unit will only use that many wounds as are left on that specific model.
