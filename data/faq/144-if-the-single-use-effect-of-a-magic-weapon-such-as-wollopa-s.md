No, Wollopa’s One Hit Wunda continues to count as a magical hand weapon even after its single-use effect is expended. Since it remains a magic item, you are not permitted to switch to another mundane weapon in that combat. Remember, general rules for switching weapons between rounds of combat still apply.
