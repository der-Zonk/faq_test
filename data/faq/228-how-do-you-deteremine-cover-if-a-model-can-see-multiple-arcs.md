question: "How do you deteremine cover if a model can see multiple arcs of an opponent unit? [please see: ⁠Cover and Arcs ] Remember that this will also be applied to woodland boundaries and the check for cover on them."
answer: |
  Take into account only the arc the shooting model is in, then apply the rules for cover. For Skirmishers, count models individually, but only those a model could see.
