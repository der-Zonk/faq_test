question: "Can an assailment spell be cast from any position in the unit? Does he need to have base contact?"
answer: |
  The caster has only to be within the fighting rank that is engaged with the unit he wants to target and does not necessarily needs to have base contact to that unit. Note that assailment spells do not lose hits if there is no base contact.
