answer: |
  The unit immediately ceases to exist. Treat the characters as units on their own and use the lone character rules if applicable. In combat, any attacks on lower initiative steps may be allocated to those characters according to the rules for multiple units in combat. Out of combat, the surviving characters and nearby units must make Panic for "nearby friend destroyed" if the US of the destroyed unit was high enough (including the surviving characters). Surviving characters who fail their Panic will Fall Back in Good Order. Any special rules of the unit cease to exist (characters still have their own special rules). If a spell was only on the unit (not being cast by self range by one of the characters), the characters lose the effect of that spell.
