answer: |
  If you reform from skirmishing formation, maintain the centre of the unit as good as possible and rank all models up around that point. You may freely chose the facing of the unit. Place command group models accordingly. Every model may move up to twice its movement characteristic as stated under maneuvers. Remove any skirmishers as casualties that are not able to rank up.
