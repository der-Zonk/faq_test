turn_order: "4-3 Combat Phase Break Test"
category: "Basic Rules"
question: "If an enemy unit loses combat and will Give Ground off the battlefield, what are the winning unit's options?"
answer: |
  The winner can attempt to restrain and reform as normal. If the unit would Follow Up, they do not move as there is no enemy to move into contact with (and a unit can only overrun if the enemy is destroyed before the break test).
