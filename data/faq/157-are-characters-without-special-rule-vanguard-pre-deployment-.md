Yes, if the banner explicitly grants the Vanguard special rule to the entire unit then the character can Vanguard. However, the GW FAQ clarifies that a character does not gain Vanguard if it joins a unit that has the rule only in its profile. This distinction arises because Vanguard in a unit’s profile does not automatically extend to joined characters unless specifically stated by an upgrade, like a banner, that applies to the entire unit.
