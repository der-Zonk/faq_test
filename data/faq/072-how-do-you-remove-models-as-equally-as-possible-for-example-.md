You can determine one model after the other by dividing the number of remaining models in each group by the number of models in that group removed already plus 1. The higher number will be the group of models where one model needs to be removed. In case of tie the attacker decides. So if you have 8 Models Group A and 2 Models Group B you would remove: A A (A or B) (B or A) A A (A or B) (B or A) A A
