question: "When calculating how many models can shoot using Volley Fire, when do you round?"
referenced_rules: |
  Volley Fire CRB 180
answer: |
  You round after calculating the models in each rank. Example: For a unit that is 5 models wide and 5 ranks deep on level ground, 5 from the first rank, 3 each from the second (5/2=2.5, rounded to 3), third, fourth, and fifth ranks can shoot. In total, 17 models will shoot.
