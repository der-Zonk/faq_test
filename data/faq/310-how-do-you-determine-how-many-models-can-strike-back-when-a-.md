  GW FAQ
---
When resolving combat, GW FAQ states that models in the Fighting Rank that are able to fight are removed and after that models that are able to fight in the Supporting rank (Spears) are removed. Note that the FAQ on the Fighting Rank specifies that only models within M" are able to fight, so remove these models from the Fighting Rank first, reducing their attacks and then reduce models in the Supporting rank within M" to reduce the supporting attacks. After that, the unit cannot strike back (except for characters and champion) and casualties are applied to the unit normally. If the unit has two fighting ranks, you may choose from which of the two ranks and from which side to remove models. For single-rank units, alternate the removal of models from each end of the fighting rank.
