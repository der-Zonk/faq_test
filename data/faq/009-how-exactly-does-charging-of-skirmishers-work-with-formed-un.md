When a formed unit of any type (be it Close Order, Open Order and so on) charges a unit of Skirmishers, it must endeavour to move as directly as possible into contact with the closestvisible model in the target unit. As usual, the charging unit may wheel once, at any point, during its move). This means you wheel the minimal distance needed to have contact with the closest visible model of the skirmishing unit and then charge forward in as straight a line as possible until you make contact. Upon contact, the skirmishing unit forms up as described in the skirmisher rules. To avoid abusive situations this should only apply if there is sufficient movement left. First priority is to complete the charge by get in contact with an enemy model. The skirmisher should align to the unit once contact is made rather than the unit having to manoeuvre to the facing of the skirmisher
