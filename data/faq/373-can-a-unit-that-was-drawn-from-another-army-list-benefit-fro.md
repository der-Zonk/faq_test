question: "Can a unit that was drawn from another army list benefit from special rules that mention \"friendly <faction> units\", for example, a Chaos Spawn in a Beastmen Brayherd Army benefit from a Herdstone?"
referenced_rules: |
  Beastmen Brayherds
answer: |
  Yes, as it has been picked as part of a Beastmen Brayherds army, although it originates from the Warriors of Chaos rules. This applies for all similar unit entries, which are taken as part of the army list (not as mercenaries or allies except for allied armies of infamies in their corresponding grand army).
