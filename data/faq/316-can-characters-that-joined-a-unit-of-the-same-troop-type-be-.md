answer: |
  No, the only change that GW's errata makes is to prevent characters of different types from receiving the protection enjoyed by same-type characters in units. When there are fewer than five rank and file models in a unit, the second paragraph of "Enemy Shooting" in the errata gives you instructions of how such characters can be hit when their units aren't of sufficient size.
