question: "Can the rules Shield of the Lady and Verminous Valour, which both allow a character to ‘retire’ by ‘moving through the ranks’, be used outside of combat? These rules specify they can be used 'at any time', but also directly refer to 'the fighting rank' and 'the combat', and the rule for 'moving through the ranks’"

answer: |
  No, these rules directly refer to 'the fighting rank' and 'the combat' which only apply in combat, and involve 'moving through the ranks' which requires the unit to be engaged and the character to return to its original position as soon as it disengages. Note that you cannot use it as a reaction on already stated or announced actions. This means while resolving a combat you have to use it at the end of an initiative step, before targets of models' attacks are announced. You can use it outside of resolving the combat at any time, given the unit is engaged in combat.
