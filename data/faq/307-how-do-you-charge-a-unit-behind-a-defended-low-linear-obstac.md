question: "How do you charge a unit behind a defended Low linear obstacle?"
answer: |
  Charge the LLO and align towards the LLO instead of the unit. Note that you have to charge the LLO in a way that at least one model of the charging unit is in the front arc of the defending unit, else the charge is considered to be a failed charge. Maximise in a way that as many models as possible are within M" of each other. Also remember that a Lance blunts if charging a unit behind a LLO because it is considered to have conducted a disordered charge.
