question: "How do I determine the troop type of a unit that includes rank-and-file models with two different troop types?"
answer: |
  Use the unit type stated in the primary Unit entry (War Beasts / Cavalry for Primal Warhounds for example). However, Rank Bonus and Special Rules that affect models can be applied to individual models (using generals Ld, getting a third rank bonus with horde if the rank consists entirely of Infantry etc).
