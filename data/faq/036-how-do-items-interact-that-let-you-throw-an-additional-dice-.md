question: "How do Items interact that let you throw an additional dice and discard the lowest and items that enforce you to roll an additional dice and discard the highest? Do they cancel themselves out so you just roll 2 dice or do they make you roll 4 dice discarding highest and lowest (making double 1s even more likely)"
