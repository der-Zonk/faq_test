question: "A unit affected by certain spells (Earthen Ramparts) or formations (marching column) cannot charge or make a charge move. Units that pursue/overrun into an enemy count as having made a charge move (if you contact an enemy unit). Does being unable to charge prevent those units from entering combat?"

  Pursuit Overrun CRB 156-157
answer: |
  No, a charge move/charging is only made during the Charge phase. Pursuit/overrun into an enemy unit are unaffected by effects that prevent them from charging - they just count as having charged if they make contact
