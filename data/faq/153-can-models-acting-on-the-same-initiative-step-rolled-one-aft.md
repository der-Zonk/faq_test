question: "Can models acting on the same Initiative step, rolled one after another, decide to react to changes in the positions of characters, or decide one by one whether to strike at a character or the unit?"
answer: |
  No, all attacks at the same Initiative step are considered to happen simultaneously. Therefore, changes in the positions of characters, such as a handmaiden retiring after striking, do not affect the resolution of other attacks on that Initiative step. Models attacking on the same Initiative step can still target the character as if she were in her original position.
