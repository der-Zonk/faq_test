turn_order: "0 General Rules"
category: "Special Rules"
question: "Do other special rules also applies to units that are not yet on the battlefield (or that have left the battlefield for a turn) ? For instance, do they have to roll for Stupidity at the Start of turn sub-phase ? Can they roll for Gaze of the Gods at the Command sub-phase?"

Units don't count as long as they are not on the battlefield, they don't get to use their special rules.
