question: "How do you charge Skirmishers with Skirmishers?"
referenced_rules: |
  Skirmishers CRB 184f
answer: |
  Pivot the closest skirmisher directly towards the closest visible model. Charge in straight lines as directly as possible towards the closest visible model without further pivoting or wheeling. When you make contact, align the defending model to the charging model. Then build up a fighting rank as described in the rulebook - for skirmishers vs. skirmishers, every model that is able to reach the fighting rank will do so. After that, the defending unit forms up.
