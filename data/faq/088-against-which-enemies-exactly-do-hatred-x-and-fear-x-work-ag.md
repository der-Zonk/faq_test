answer: |
  Only against models which are X. For instance, Hatred (Orcs & Goblins) does not reference the faction name "Orc & Goblin Tribes", it only references models which contain an orc and/or a goblin (including Chaos Dwarfs' Black Orcs). Models with Fear (Elves) fear models which contain an elf. Models with Hatred (Wizards) hate all models containing a wizard.
