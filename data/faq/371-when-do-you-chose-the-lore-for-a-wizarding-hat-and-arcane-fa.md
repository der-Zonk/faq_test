question: "When do you chose the lore for a Wizarding Hat and Arcane Familiar? And when do you chose how many spells from which lore are rolled for?"
referenced_rules: |
  Arcane Familiar CRB 343
answer: |
  In both cases, the magic lore has to be noted in the army list. You can roll spells and do the dice allocation for the number of spells before deployment in the order you chose for all your wizards.
