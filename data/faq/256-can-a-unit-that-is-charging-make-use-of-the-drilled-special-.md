No, unless the unit is in marching column and the minimum widt requested to leave the marching column already causes accidental / a multiple target charge. In that case the unit is allowed to Redress the ranks to be able to charge and conduct a multiple charge against other targets, but only against those needed to actually conduct the charge.
