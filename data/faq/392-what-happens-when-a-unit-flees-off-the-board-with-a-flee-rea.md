question: "What happens when a unit flees off the  board with a flee reaction? How is that unit charged and is the charging unit allowed to leave the board?"
---
Conduct the Flee move off the board. Leave the unit in place as close as possible to the position it would end the move - as the table allows. Conduct the charge move to the fleeing unit adhering to all charge move criteria, without the need to maximize. If the charging unit would leave the board, it is allowed to do so, as if it had conducted a pursuit off the Board. If it doesn’t catch the fleeing unit, it is Not allowed to attempt to Reform, even that the fleeing unit counts as destroyed. Note that the unit is not allowed to move in the following compulsory move phase since it already has moved in the charge move phase and will re-enter the board in it's next compulsory move phase.
