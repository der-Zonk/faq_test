The Grail Reliquae is a single model. It might have the stats of 6 Pilgrims but it's still just a single Heavy Infantry model, which has a Unit Strength of 1. No matter how many wounds it suffers it still has 6 attacks. It is not in Marching Column if it's the only model remaining as single models cannot be in Marching Column. Attacks cannot be directed against the Grail Reliquae - all hits will be assigned to the unit. This means the unit will not benefit from the Blessing unless the Grail Reliquae is the last remaining model. If a template hits the Grail Reliquae, it results in a normal hit assigned to the unit - note that "risking being hit" for the Grail Reliquae works the same way as for any other model with that base size.
