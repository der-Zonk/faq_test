question: "Can you choose when to use the Opal Amulet or are you forced to use it against the first wound?"
referenced_rules: |
  High Elves
  Single Use Magic Items CRB 337
answer: |
  The item gives the bearer a ward save when used, but the player chooses when to activate single use items. Therefore, the Amulet does not have to be used exclusively against the first wound.
