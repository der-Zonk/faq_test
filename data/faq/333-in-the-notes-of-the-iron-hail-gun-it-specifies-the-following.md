question: "In the notes of the Iron Hail Gun it specifies the following, \"Notes: A model armed with an iron hail gun suffers no negative modifiers for firing at long range, for using the Multiple Shots (D3) special rule, or whilst making a Stand & Shoot charge reaction.\" Does this effect only apply to the use of the Iron Hail Gun, or the model as a whole?"

  Just the iron hail gun, as the note is part of the weapon's rules, it only applies to the weapon.
