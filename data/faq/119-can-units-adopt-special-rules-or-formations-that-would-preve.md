question: "Can Units adopt Special Rules or Formations that would prevent characters from joining them, while joined by such a character? (for example: grail pilgrims becoming unbreakable while joined by a non-unbreakable character or units in open order reforming to skirmishers while joined by a character of a different sub-type or troop type)."

  Characters & Units CRB 207
answer: |
  The character must first leave the unit, before the unit may adapt skirmish formation. If the character already joined the unit prior to the special rule coming into effect, the whole unit including the character gets to use the special rule.
