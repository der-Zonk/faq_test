question: "Do you get to chose a charge reaction if accidentally contacted during a charge, for example if a charged unit choses flee and flees through a friendly unit - and the charging unit would hit that said friendly unit if it continues to charge?"

  Accidental Contact during a Charge CRB 131
  Pursuit into a fresh Enemy CRB 157

This is accidental contact during a charge. Follow the procedure on 131 - the charging unit only counts as having redirect prior so it can make contact - you don't get a charge reaction, which only is available after a unit is selected as charge target during a redirect or charge declaration. Note this also means you do not get a charge reaction if an enemy unit pursuits or overruns into you as explained on 157.
