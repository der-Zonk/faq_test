question: "If a unit A is engaged with two units B and C, one (B) of which is a single character in a challenge, the rules say that all models of the first unit A which normally must attack the character B due to closeness instead are allowed to attack the other unit C. How does this work with fighting ranks and \"full attacks\"?"

  How many attacks? CRB 146

Since "the unit" is specified in the FAQ about fighting ranks, only the models within M" of Unit C can attack that unit. Please note that these models only get to make 1 A, regardless if they are in base contact with B or not.
