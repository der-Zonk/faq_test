question: "When do you determine which models can attack during a combat? For example, if a character retires using verminous valour or similar abilities after making its attacks, can a model with a lower initiative replacing it in the fighting rank still make its attacks?"

  Determine Who Can Fight CRB 145ff

When the combat is chosen, after challenges are issued and characters moved through the ranks, check which models are in which fighting rank and whom they can attack. Models that step into a fighting rank later or that are added later to a fighting rank cannot attack in that fighting rank. See also ID356.
