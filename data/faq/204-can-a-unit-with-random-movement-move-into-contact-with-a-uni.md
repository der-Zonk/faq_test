question: "Can a unit with random movement move into contact with a unit that was not \"at least partly in its front arc\" as long as it fulfills all criteria for charging (single wheel etc.) stated on 126 (see GW FAQ)? For example, an enemy unit that is behind the unit with random movement but reachable with a single wheel?"

Yes, you don't need LoS or the enemy unit to be in your front arc since you do not declare the charge. As long as you fulfill the charge criteria (shortest route, only one wheel etc.), that is a perfectly acceptable "move into contact".
