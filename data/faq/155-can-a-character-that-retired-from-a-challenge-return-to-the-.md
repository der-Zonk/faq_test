question: "Can a character that retired from a challenge return to the fighting rank because of follow-up moves or a shrinking unit?"

  Characters CRB 205 - 210
answer: |
  Yes, but only if maintaining the unit's formation requires the character to step forward into the fighting rank due to casualties or shrinking ranks. This applies when the only available position to preserve the unit's structure is in the fighting rank.
