question: "Does a unit gain the benefit of a defended Low linear obstacle when the charging unit ends the charge move on top of the LLO in base contact to the unit or at a part of the unit where there is no LLO"
referenced_rules: |
  Low Linear Obstacle CRB 159
answer: |
  The last sentence only mentions Fly (X) as an exception, so a charging unit always suffers the disordered charge but only loses impact hits and stomp attacks and full attacks if it has no base contact/for models without base contact
