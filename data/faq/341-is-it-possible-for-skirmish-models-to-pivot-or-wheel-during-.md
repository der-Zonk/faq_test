question: "Is it possible for skirmish models to pivot or wheel during normal moves / marching or charging?"
answer: |
  Yes, given that no point of the model exceeds its maximum movement. Also note that you are only allowed to change your path of direction (aka wheel) only once during a skirmishers charge move. However, to make combat engagements possible at all, skirmishers can freely pivot during any time of their movement (charges and normal movement) without changing their path of movement.
