question: "What happens when a unit falls below Unit Strength 10 after a Handmaiden retires to the rear rank of that unit?"
referenced_rules: |
  Shield of the Lady FoF 87
answer: |
  The Unit Strength 10 condition is checked at the moment the Handmaiden retires to the rear rank. If the condition is met at that time, the Lady’s effects remain active until the combat ends, even if the unit later falls below Unit Strength 10.
