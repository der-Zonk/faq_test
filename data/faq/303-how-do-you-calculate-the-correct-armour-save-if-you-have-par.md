Parry cannot improve your armour save beyond a 3+ value. This means that when calculating the base armour save (before any roll modifiers), Parry will cap the result at 3+ if not improved by other means. However, if the unit is affected by a rule that modifies the armour save value itself (e.g. Plague of Rust), you can balance positive and negative modifiers against each other. For example Rune of Oath & Steel. Note that modifiers to the armour save roll—like Armour Piercing, Totem of Rust, etc.—do not interact with this cap and leave it at 3+. They apply after the save value is determined, and reduce the final roll needed for success.
