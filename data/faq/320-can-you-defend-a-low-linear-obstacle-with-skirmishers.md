answer: |
  No, since you do not have a front rank. However, if you are under the effect of an ability that counts the unit as defending a LLO (Earthen Ramparts, Entrench, etc...) you get the bonus. Note however, that some of these rules cease to apply when the unit moves; forming up to a charging enemy (among other things) would remove these benefits.
