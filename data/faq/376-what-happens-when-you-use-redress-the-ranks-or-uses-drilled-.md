  Redress the Ranks CRB 125
---
When a unit performs Redress the Ranks, Models can be either removed from the front rank or added to the front rank, divided as equally as possible on either sides of the unit to maintain its centre. When removing models, the last models to remove must be the characters, then the command group, always keeping the standard bearer in the front rank and as close to the centre as possible. Command group models removed from the front rank must go to the second rank (and third in case of a single column). Characters removed from the front rank must go to the rear rank. The player choses the position of all models in their respective back ranks. When adding models to the front rank, the opposite order must be followed: first the command group, then the characters, before rank and file models. The position of added models can be chosen by the controlling player, but must respect the positioning rule for the command group and for characters: standard bearer as close to the centre as possible, command group models to either side, characters anywhere in the front rank. Note that characters may be placed among the command group.
