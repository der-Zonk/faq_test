question: "How do you resolve forming up with non-fitting characters in Skirmishing units?"
---
Form a fighting rank, starting with the model that made contact first. Ignore the base difference for characters, the extra base size will make very little difference to the shape of the unit - maybe there will be some slight gaps inside of the unit. The controlling player may move the remaining models in any order, given that the rules for forming (up to single movement characteristic) are adhered. A character that is not in the fighting rank might then move through the ranks to get in base contact with an opponent. Remember it is not allowed to have more characters than non-characters in the fighting rank.
