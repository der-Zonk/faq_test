question: How does the Compare feature work?
category: Shooting

The Compare feature allows you to see differences between two versions:

1. **Added FAQs** - shown in green
2. **Modified FAQs** - shown in yellow with detailed field changes
3. **Deleted FAQs** - shown in red with strikethrough

This makes it easy to track what changed between deployments!
