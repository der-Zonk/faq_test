Yes, since a cannon ball hits a model and not the unit, the character is hit (targeted by an attack that allows a specific model within the unit to be targeted). If there are 5 or more rank and file models that character is allowed to make a Look Out, Sir! - roll. This also applies to unit champions or special models within units.
