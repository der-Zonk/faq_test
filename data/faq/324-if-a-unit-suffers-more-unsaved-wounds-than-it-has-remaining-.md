Excess wounds are applied after Regeneration. However, remember that Regeneration saves are not mandatory. The unit can chose to not roll a single regeneration save to not give up more CR than it has remaining wounds. If the unit choses to roll Regeneration saves, it can chose to roll any number up to the number of unsaved wounds. After all Regeneration saves have been made, the unit loses an amount of unsaved wounds up to the maximum of its remaining wound count.
