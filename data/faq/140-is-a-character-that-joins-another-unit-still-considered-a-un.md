They form together a single unit. Whenever the word 'unit' is mentioned in a special rule the unit already has or when the rule comes from a magical banner in that unit, apply rules for both the character and the unit he joined. Special Rules a character has only apply to the unit if "and any unit they have joined" is mentioned or similar.Please note that some special rules could cease to apply if a character without a special rule joins a unit or vice versa (e.g. Counter Charge).Special rules that affect models or weapons do NOT translate from one model to the whole unit or vice versa (a unit with poisoned attacks will not give the character poisoned attacks when joining).Special rules that only need the majority of models to have the special rule will work (e.g. Reserve Move).If a character that casted a spell or used an ability "that affects the caster and any unit he has joined" leaves a unit after casting that spell/using the ability, only the caster has the effect, but if he joins another unit, that unit will benefit from that effect too.if a character in a unit becomes the target of the effects ethereal, fly or any other rule that would prevent them from joining, the character can still be part of the unit, but once they leave it, they are not allowed to join again as long as the character has these special rules.if a unit with a character becomes the target of a spell that grants them a Special Rule or Ability, the character can benefit from it while it has joined the unit even if the Special Rule or Ability would prevent them from joining, but will lose it the moment it leaves the unit. If all the models of the unit are removed as casualties, the unit ceases to exist immediately, and the character loses the Special Rule or Ability.Anyway, if a character moved or marched before joining a unit, the unit will not count as moved/marched and vice versa.
