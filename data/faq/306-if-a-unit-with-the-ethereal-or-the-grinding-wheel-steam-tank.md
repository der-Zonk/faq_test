answer: |
  Yes. They can charge and will only contact the LLO, losing impact hits and can only do one attack per model. Note that for a Steam Tank and an Iron Daemon LLOs count as open terrain, so they can actually ignore the LLO and contact the unit directly, effectively denying the defending of the LLO for them, charging on top of a physical LLO or just in base contact in the case of Earthen Ramparts/Entrenched.
