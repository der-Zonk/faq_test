question: "How many demonic gifts can a demon of chaos character buy? Are demonic gifts restricted like magic items?"

  Daemons of Chaos Demonic Gifts

Since there are no categories for the demonic gifts mentioned as in the rulebook for magic items, a character can buy as many different gifts as his point limit allows. Demonic gifts without an asterik can only be taken once per army and only a demonic locus can buy a single icon.
