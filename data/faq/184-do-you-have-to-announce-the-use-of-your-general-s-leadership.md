category: "Basic Rules"
question: "Do you have to announce the use of your general’s leadership before a break or leadership test or after the test is done?"
referenced_rules: |
  Inspiring Presence CRB 203
answer: |
  Since the sequence for break tests clearly states rolling first and then comparing and checking later, you can roll first and then use Inspiring Presence or not, depending on the dice roll. For leadership tests, Inspiring Presence is optional too, since under Inspiring Presence "can” is stated.
