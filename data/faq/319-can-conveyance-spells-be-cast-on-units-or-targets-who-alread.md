answer: |
  Unless otherwise specified in the spell's description, conveyance spells can be cast on any valid friendly unit, respecting the normal criteria for choosing a target (i.e. within the caster's vision arc and range, not engaged in combat). Specific constraints and/or allowances may be defined in the spell's description, e.g. regarding the target unit/character's movement before and/or after the spell, or whether it is fleeing or engaged in combat.
