category: "Basic Rules"
question: "Can you decide to alter the charge path of a charging unit to avoid discarding the higher dice to make your charge successful, if you would instead fail the charge because of the terrain (by rolling a 1 and a 6 on the charge roll for instance, in addition to -1 M)?"

Yes. You define the path taken by the unit after rolling the dice (it's already the case for wheeling to maximise contact) because you must move by the shortest route possible to reach the charge target. Make charges happen if possible.
