question: "Do units in combat or outside of line of sight of the shooting units protect \"lone characters\" from being shot at, given that they are closer to the shooting unit than the lone character?"
referenced_rules: |
  Lone Characters CRB 206
answer: |
  No, target implies "legal target". Therefore, the unit is not able to protect the lone character and the character can be shot at if no other unit is eligible to protect that character.
