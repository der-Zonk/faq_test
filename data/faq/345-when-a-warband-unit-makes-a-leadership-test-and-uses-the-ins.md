question: "When a Warband unit makes a leadership test and uses the Inspiring Presence of a warband general (that is not in the unit). How are the multiple warband bonuses applied to this leadership test? Note that this question only adresses the warband modifier and refers to the wording of the Warband special rule."

Only the warband modifier of the Generals unit (if he is in a warband unit) is used. If the general is not in a warband unit, then no warband modifier can be claimed.
