question: "Can the champion of a unit which swapped their shields for another weapon still buy a magical shield? And can the champion chose to wield a separate equipment than the unit (if he wears a mundane/magical weapon?)?"

Yes, just like how a character doesn't have to buy a generic shield in order to have a magic one. You just need the shield as a possible option to access the magic version. Yes, the champion can use a different weapon option if he has access to.
