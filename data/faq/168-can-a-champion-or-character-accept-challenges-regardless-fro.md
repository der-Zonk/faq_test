A: No. Challenges can only be accepted by models which are either placed in or immediately adjacent (as non-fittiging characters) to the fighting rank engaged with the unit the challenge was issued from (or the extended fighting rank behind that in case of Infantry using the press of battle rule). While all fighting ranks in a combat are part of the battle, the wording on page 210 suggests challenges are limited to the specific engaged rank directly facing the enemy.
