question: "Goad Beast: During the Command sub-phase of their turn, this character may goad a single friendly model whose troop type is ‘monster’ and that is within their Command range (including their own mount). Until the end of this turn, that model gains a +D3 modifier to its Attacks characteristic (to a maximum of 10). Does this also affect the rider?"

  No, only the mount, see 'including their own mount' - see Split Profile (monster mount) - The character and mount each use their own Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Strength, Initiative and Attacks characteristics,
