question: "If a Skaven Character uses his verminous valour rule, does he retire, thus any special rules he contributes to the unit are lost and he cannot enter the fighting rank again in subsequent phases of combat?"

Yes. Verminous valour is clear: the character retires. Follow the normal rules for characters retiring, with the exception that the character will continue to confer their leadership to the unit. However, the character has not refused a challenge, and is therefore able to move through the ranks agin in future round of combat.
