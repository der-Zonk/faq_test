question: "When a character leaves a unit, how is that character affected by any spells or effects that modify the unit's movement? Do they maintain the unit formation they were in, or always move as a skirmisher?"
answer: |
  Movement is checked when a character or unit begins their movement. They move as a skirmisher, and move through other models in their unit freely. Any spells or effects (positive or negative) affect the character's movement during the Remaining Moves phase in which the character leaves the unit. This means that if the unit is affected by Miasmic Mirage, the character cannot march, and if the unit is affected by Steed of Shadows, the character may move using Fly (12). If for any reason the character does not follow the Lone Character rules when not in a unit (such as a character on a light chariot), then they must adhere to the normal movement rules for their respective unit type when leaving the unit.
