Per GW FAQ, characters can be placed among a unit's command. However, a standard bearer must be placed in the center of the front rank (or as close as possible) and command models must be placed in the front rank. Characters cannot displace command models from the front rank or the standard bearer from the center of the unit, but may displace a champion or musician to another position within the front rank. Rank & file models cannot be placed between command models (including characters) and the standard bearer.
