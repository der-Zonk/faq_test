question: "How do abilities like Gnashing Maws (gigantic spawn of chaos) interact with regeneration? What about effects that trigger when a model loses its last wound, such as Timmm-berr! or Explosive Demise (warpfire dragon)?"

  Regeneration is no longer a save, so a wound from Gnashing Maws counts as an unsaved wound regardless of whether regeneration is successful. Effects that require a model to lose its last wound will only trigger if the model actually destroyed and removed as a casualty.
