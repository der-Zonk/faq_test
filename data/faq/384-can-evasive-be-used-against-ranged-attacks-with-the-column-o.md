question: "Can evasive be used against ranged attacks with the Column of Fire rule (such as the Dwarf flame cannon)?"
referenced_rules: |
  Fire Throwers CRB 229
  Evasive CRB 168
answer: |
  Column of Fire's "intended target" does not need to be a unit, but can instead be a point on the table (similar to the Cannon Fire) rule. Because the unit is not targeted specifically, they cannot use Evasive.
