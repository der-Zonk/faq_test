question: "A unit affected by certain spells (Earthen Ramparts), formation (marching column) or that has rallied cannot charge or make a charge move. Random Movement has to adhere to all charge criteria during the move \"as any other charging unit\". Does being unable to charge prevent a model using Random Movement from entering combat during Compulsory Movement?"

answer: |
  Yes. Contacting a unit with Random Movement is basically charging. You cannot make contact, those units have to stop 1" away from the enemy unit while unable to charge and will not trigger any rules affected by charging. Note that units cannot use Counter Charge under these conditions at all, as clarified by GW FAQ.
