question: "Does the change in Regeneration mean that i can use a Regeneration save for any case a model loses a wound, even if just losing a wound is stated? E.g. can you attempt a Regeneration save against Peril Tests, Unstable, Deamonic Instability, Dangerous Terrain and similar cases?"

Yes, as long that it is not mentioned that regeneration saves are not permitted against these attacks. Please note that due to the old wording of regeneration, Killing Blow, Monster Slayer and similar wordings do NOT allow regeneration saves to be made against the wounds lost with these special rules.
