question: "In the army list for most Armies of Infamy, there will be a text box stating: \"Any models that have the option to purchase magic items will have the option to purchase Common or (Faction) magic items). How does this apply to models in the army that are drawn from army books with a different selection of magic items?"

Models can select magic items from their original army book only (Shaggoths in Wolves of the Sea get only Beastmen items).
