No. While Charging and failed Charging are no stated exclusively, since Wailing Dirge is an attack made in the shooting phase (Shooting Attack), it can't be used after Charging, even being a special rule (like other shooting attacks resolving from special rules) since the permission is not granted by the special rule.
