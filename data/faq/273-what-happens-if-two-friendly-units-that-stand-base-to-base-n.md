turn_order: "4-4 Follow Up & Pursuit"
category: "Basic Rules"
question: "What happens if two friendly units that stand base-to-base next to each other win combat and their opponent flees from them not straight backwards. Can they pursuit? If they pivot to align center-to-center, they would both overlap with each other."

answer: |
  Pursuit moves are done one after each other. During a Pivot, units ignore the presence of other units. While you go straight forward after that pivot and you cannot wheel to maximize or go around other units, consider this pivot being part of the pursuit move. First pivot, then pursuit with one unit, then with another. In most cases, this will lead to the second unit being blocked to move, but the first unit is able to pursuit.
